  "I am a JavaScript developer with a proactive, problem solving attitude. Since 2016 working with clients building company and e-commerce websites. Covered a role as Junior Frontend Developer at iGamingNuts for 2+ years. Hands-on experience with React, Angular, jQuery, popular frontend libraries and UI/UX. Currently creating custom software and e-commerce solutions. I bring a creative mindset with an eye on aesthetics, SOLID principles, clean code, RWD and Core Web Vitals. Rather than collecting certifications (however I have one in JavaScript from Software Development Academy) I prefer diving deep into coding and solving problems for my clients. I'm constantly learning and growing. I'm passionate about elevating user experiences through innovative solutions, ensuring both performance and smooth transitions. Altough I really enjoy Angular, React best fits most of my current clients needs. I'd like to contribute my skills to ambitious, interesting projects. Join me on LinkedIn and feel free to contact me.";
