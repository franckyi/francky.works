      I&apos;m a JavaScript developer with a{" "}
      <strong>proactive, problem solving attitude</strong>. Since 2016 working
      with clients building company and e-commerce websites. In 2021 covered a
      role as Junior Frontend Developer at iGamingNuts for 2+ years. Hands-on
      experience with React, Angular, jQuery, popular frontend libraries and
      UI/UX. Currently creating custom software and e-commerce solutions. I
      bring a creative mindset with an eye on aesthetics, SOLID principles,
      clean code, RWD and Core Web Vitals. Altough I really enjoy Angular, React
      best fits most of my current clients needs. I&apos;d like to contribute my
      skills to ambitious, interesting projects. Join me on LinkedIn and feel
      free to contact me.
